## day 1 - 11 jul (fri)
for the first day, after settling in, we formed our teams and started brainstorming ideas (after some caffeine)

before settling on our final (floral!) idea, some of our scrapped ideas include:
- calcifer from howl's moving castle
- real life minecraft redstone minecart??
- mini rhythm game (like osu or taiko)

we figured that if we incorporated minecraft flowers into a codebreaker-style game, we retained a sense of whimsy while also making it more interactive. then, we got the idea to add two players for extra competition and fun (!!!)

basically, the firmware generates a random code of four colours which the players have to guess the sequence of by slotting minecraft flowers of the respective colours into four sockets. then, leds below the sockets tell you whether the flower is correct or wrong by lighting up red or green. to distinguish the different types of flowers, we are using resistors of varying resistance to complete the circuit. (we tried going through potential ideas for this like a photoresistor or distance sensors, but this was the most viable way)

by the time we figured out the circuit and went to collect our hardware, it was 2am. we discovered and soldered an orpheus pico and found this really fun round oled screen (thanks joe). we also got very many resistors which are really hard to distinguish in low light and while sleep deprived.

at about 2.40am, we tried to clear up the mess and created the repo. sadly, we realised that we had forgotten to get the leds and resistors and include them in the wiring ): job for tomorrow. goodnight!
