# day 2 - 12 jul (sat)
today, we woke up super early (except for one of us) and split up tasks.

we did some cad and 3d printed the flowers! we decided on four colours according to the filament - dandelion for yellow, tulip for pink, cornflower for blue and allium for purple. for the tulips, we printed out individual blocks and glued them together because it didnt need too many 
the bottom plate needed some adjustment because the resistor holes didn't print right, and the size was kind of off. so i guess that's a problem for tomorrow.
