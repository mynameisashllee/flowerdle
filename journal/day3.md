# day 3 - 13 jul 
Its the last full day to finish our project(#crashingout). Okay but we're on track(kind of), except our 3d prints for two of our flowers aren't here yet. We finished working on the breadboard cases which are minecraft themed as well(grass blocks!!) The queue for the 3d printer is not looking good though but apparently we'll be able to start printing at 7pm and get it by 9!.

We also refined our firmware and got it fully functioning. 

We got our prints at around 9.30 but bad news!! Our prints are all in black(lowkey cooked given our game depends on having different coloured flowers). But the paint markers saved the day and we managed to get some white paint too and we repainted the flowers but we're yet to get out breadboard case which will apparently be ready before 8 am tomorrow.

Also WHY ARE 3D PRINT SUPPORTS SO HARD TO REMOVE?? (might've accidentally injured myself with the tweezers but we're balling!!)

We painted and assembled all our flowers and our electronics and fully tested things out at around 1.20 am after undernet and IT WORKS!!!

Now we just got to work on getting all our files ready to ship(which is all over the place ngl) and we're going to hope that tomorrow's breadboard cases come in time for us to assemble it. 

Might be a long night and we're all hiked up on so much caffiene but what's the fun in a hackathon if you're not up all night doing goofy things while speedrunning right? 

Thats it for day 3, and I should probably lock in now!
